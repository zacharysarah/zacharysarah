## :wave:

I'm Zachary Sarah Corleissen (Zach, he/they).

## Technical documentation

I have 15+ years of experience in technical writing with a focus on developer docs. I'm a co-author of [Docs for Developers: An Engineer's Field Guide to Technical Writing][docs-for-devs].

I'm currently a staff technical writer at [Stripe] and contribute to various open source projects. My previous employers include the Linux Foundation, GitHub, Rackspace, and a handful of startups.

I've spoken at [FOSDEM], [KubeCon/CloudNativeCon], and Write the Docs [North America] and [Europe]. I'm actively seeking CFPs for docs talks at developer conferences and local meetups.

I proofread technical books, fiction, and other projects for which I'm passionate on a freelance basis. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:zach@corleissen.com) about availability and rates.

## Hobbies

My hobbies include lap swimming, knitting, gardening, roleplaying games, and volunteering.
