## :wave:

I'm Zachary Sarah Corleissen.

Professionally, I do developer docs, cat herding, and open source software (OSS). I'm a lead technical writer at the [CNCF] and occasionally venture into other [Linux Foundation] projects. 

I freelance proofread technical books, fiction, and projects for which I'm passionate.

My gender is masculine non-binary, prounouns are he/him or they/them.

## 🇨🇦

I'm a new immigrant to Canada, always happy to talk OSS and docs in Victoria, BC and remotely.

## 🏊🌵🧙🏻🧶🙋

My hobbies include:

- Swimming

    I'm growing my distance in hopes of exploring open water swims on and near Vancouver Island.

- Succulents

    More plants? More plants.

- Gaming

    Console, tabletop, LARP, the works.
    
- Knitting

    Canada's climate makes knitting a year-round activity. I keep swearing I'm done with lace...
    
- Volunteering

    I give time and money to Black health, queer liberation, and food security.
