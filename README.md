Hi, I'm Sarah Corleissen (she/her). I'm a transgender woman üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è living and working in Victoria, BC üá®üá¶. I have 15+ years of experience in technical writing with a focus on developer docs. 

## Technical documentation

I'm a co-author of [Docs for Developers: An Engineer's Field Guide to Technical Writing][docs-for-devs].

I'm currently the Head of Documentation for [Isovalent]. My previous employers include Stripe, the Linux Foundation, GitHub, Rackspace, and a handful of startups.

I've spoken at [PyCon US], [FOSDEM], [KubeCon/CloudNativeCon], and Write the Docs [North America] and [Europe]. I'm actively seeking CFPs for docs talks at developer conferences and local meetups.

I also talk about docs on podcasts like [Let's Talk Docs] and [fukabori.fm]. 

## Editing

I proofread technical books, fiction, and other projects on a freelance basis. Feel free to [contact me] for availability and rates.

## Hobbies

My hobbies include walking along the seaside, reading fiction, knitting sweaters, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and volunteering at UBC Medical School.
