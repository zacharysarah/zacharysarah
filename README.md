## Location 🇨🇦

I'm a new immigrant to Canada, always happy to talk OSS and docs in Victoria, BC and remotely.

## Hobbies 🏊🌵🧙🏻🧶🙋

My hobbies include:

### Swimming 🏊

I'm growing my distance in hopes of exploring open water swims on and near Vancouver Island.

### Succulents 🌵

More plants? More plants.

### Gaming 🧙🏻

Console, tabletop, LARP, the works.
    
### Knitting 🧶

Canada's climate makes knitting a year-round activity. I keep swearing I'm done with lace...
    
### Volunteering 🙋

I give time and money to Black health, queer liberation, and food security.
