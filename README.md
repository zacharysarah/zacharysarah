## :wave:

I'm Sarah Corleissen (she/her).

## Technical documentation

I have 15+ years of experience in technical writing with a focus on developer docs. I'm a co-author of [Docs for Developers: An Engineer's Field Guide to Technical Writing][docs-for-devs].

My previous employers include Stripe, the Linux Foundation, GitHub, Rackspace, and a handful of startups.

I've spoken at [PyCon US], [FOSDEM], [KubeCon/CloudNativeCon], and Write the Docs [North America] and [Europe]. I'm actively seeking CFPs for docs talks at developer conferences and local meetups.

## Editing

I proofread technical books, fiction, and other projects on a freelance basis. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:sarah@corleissen.com) for availability and rates.

## Hobbies

My hobbies include lap swimming, knitting, gardening, roleplaying games, and volunteering.
